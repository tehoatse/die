# die
Simple bash script for rolling dice I made while learning bash scripting

command die.sh without argument gives result for 1d6

die.sh -n will roll the dice without making you wait

die.sh -d will allow you define the dice you want thrown

die.sh -d 10d6 will throw 10d6 and show the results for each

die.sh -t will give you a total once all the rolling is done
